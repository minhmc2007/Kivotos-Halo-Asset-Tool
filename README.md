## üö® Critical Prerequisite: Rooted Android Environment

This script is **NOT** designed to run on a standard Windows, macOS, or desktop Linux environment out of the box. It is built specifically for a **rooted Android environment** where it can directly access the game's data files.

*   **Why?** The script uses hardcoded paths like `/sdcard/Android/data/com.nexon.bluearchive/...` which are protected by the Android operating system. Without root, these files are inaccessible.
*   **Recommended Environments:**
    *   **Termux with proot-distro:** This is the ideal way to run it. You must install a Linux distribution (like Ubuntu or Debian) inside Termux and run the script from within the proot environment.
        ```bash
        # Inside Termux
        pkg install proot-distro
        proot-distro install ubuntu
        proot-distro login ubuntu
        # Now you are in a root-like environment where you can run the script
        ```
    *   **Kali Nethunter:** A rooted environment provided by Nethunter will also work.
*   **Alternative (Not Recommended):** You could manually copy the entire `Resource` folder from your phone to a PC and modify the paths at the top of the script, but the primary design is for on-device execution.

## Features

*   **Extract & Repack:** The core functionality allows for unpacking game asset bundles and repacking them after modification.
*   **Advanced Interactive Search:** No need to guess bundle filenames.
    *   **Smart Scan:** On startup, the script intelligently finds bundles likely to contain character sprites.
    *   **Filter:** Quickly filter the list of bundles by name.
    *   **Broad Search:** If you can't find a character, you can perform a broad search across all bundle files for a keyword (e.g., "yuuka").
*   **Comprehensive Asset Handling:** Extracts various common asset types into organized folders:
    *   `Texture2D` / `Sprite` ‚Üí **.png** files
    *   `TextAsset` ‚Üí **.txt** or **.bytes** files
    *   `MonoBehaviour` ‚Üí **.json** (if type tree is available) or raw **.dat** files
    *   `AudioClip` ‚Üí **.wav** (or other formats via UnityPy's export)
*   **Manifest-Based Repacking:** Generates a `manifest.json` during extraction, which ensures a safe and accurate repacking process.
*   **Designed for Blue Archive:** Naming conventions and default paths are tailored for the Global version of Blue Archive.

## Installation

1.  **Set up Your Environment:** Ensure you are inside your rooted `proot-distro` or Nethunter session.

2.  **Install Python:** Most distributions will have Python 3 pre-installed. You can check with `python --version`.

3.  **Install Dependencies:** The script requires `UnityPy` for handling the bundles and `Pillow` for image processing.
    ```bash
    pip install UnityPy Pillow
    ```

4.  **Download the Script:** Download the script (e.g., `ba_asset_tool.py`) into your environment.

## Configuration

The script has configuration variables at the top. You should verify they match your device's setup, especially if you are using a different version of the game (e.g., JP/KR).

```python
# --- Blue Archive Specific Configuration ---
BLUE_ARCHIVE_BUNDLE_SRC_PATH = "/sdcard/Android/data/com.nexon.bluearchive/files/PUB/Resource/GameData/Android/"
DEFAULT_EXTRACTED_OUTPUT_BASE_DIR = "/sdcard/extracted/"
DEFAULT_REPACKED_OUTPUT_DIR = "/sdcard/repacked/"
```

*   `BLUE_ARCHIVE_BUNDLE_SRC_PATH`: Path to the game's asset bundles.
*   `DEFAULT_EXTRACTED_OUTPUT_BASE_DIR`: Where all extracted asset folders will be created.
*   `DEFAULT_REPACKED_OUTPUT_DIR`: Where new, repacked bundles will be saved.

## Usage

The script is operated via a command-line interface with two main commands: `extract` and `repack`.

### Extracting Assets

The `extract` command launches the interactive menu to help you find and unpack a bundle.

**Command:**
```bash
python ba_asset_tool.py extract [output_subfolder_name]
```
*   `[output_subfolder_name]`: (Optional) A custom name for the folder where assets will be extracted. If you omit this, the script will use the bundle's filename.

**Example 1: Basic Extraction**

This will start the interactive menu and, once you select a bundle, extract its contents to a folder named after the bundle inside `/sdcard/extracted/`.

```bash
python ba_asset_tool.py extract
```

**Interactive Menu:**
1.  The script will perform a **Smart Scan** and present a numbered list of likely character sprite bundles.
2.  You can:
    *   Enter a **number** to select and extract a bundle.
    *   Enter **`f`** to filter the current list by a keyword.
    *   Enter a **name** (e.g., `hoshino`) to perform a **Broad Search** for any bundle containing that name and add it to the list.
    *   Enter **`q`** to quit.

**Example 2: Extraction to a Custom Folder**

This will extract the bundle you select to `/sdcard/extracted/MyCustomAru/`.

```bash
python ba_asset_tool.py extract MyCustomAru
```

### Understanding the Extracted Folder

After extraction, your output folder will look something like this:

```
/sdcard/extracted/MyCustomAru/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ AudioClips/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ MonoBehaviours_JSON/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ TextAssets/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Textures/
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Aru_Weapon_Tex_a81234.png
‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ ...
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ manifest.json  <-- VERY IMPORTANT
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ ...
```

The **`manifest.json`** file is critical. It contains the blueprint of the original bundle and tells the script how to put everything back together. **Do not delete or rename it!**

### Repacking Assets

The `repack` command takes an extracted folder (containing your modifications and the original `manifest.json`) and builds a new `.bundle` file.

**Command:**
```bash
python ba_asset_tool.py repack "path/to/input_dir" "output_filename.bundle"
```
*   `path/to/input_dir`: The full path to the folder containing your modified assets and the `manifest.json`.
*   `output_filename.bundle`: The name you want to give to the new, repacked bundle file. It will be saved in the `DEFAULT_REPACKED_OUTPUT_DIR`.

**Example:**

Let's say you modified the texture files inside `/sdcard/extracted/MyCustomAru/`. To repack it:

```bash
python ba_asset_tool.py repack "/sdcard/extracted/MyCustomAru" "Repacked_Aru_Special.bundle"
```

This will:
1.  Read the `manifest.json` in `/sdcard/extracted/MyCustomAru/`.
2.  Use the original bundle as a template.
3.  Replace the original assets with your modified ones.
4.  Save the new bundle as `/sdcard/repacked/Repacked_Aru_Special.bundle`.
