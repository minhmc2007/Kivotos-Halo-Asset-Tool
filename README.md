# Kivotos Halo Asset Tool
A complete, on-device solution for modding **Blue Archive** on Android. This tool provides a powerful command-line interface to copy, extract, repack, and deploy Unity asset bundles directly on your phone.

It features a hybrid architecture, using a Termux-based "Orchestrator" to handle high-privilege file operations and a `proot-distro` Linux container as a clean "Workshop" for processing game assets.

## Features

*   **End-to-End Workflow:** Supports the full modding cycle: `copy`, `extract`, `repack`, and `deploy`.
*   **Automated Setup:** A single `install.sh` script prepares the entire complex environment for you.
*   **Smart Permission Handling:** Automatically detects and uses `root (su)` or `Shizuku (rish)` to access protected game files.
*   **Hybrid Architecture:**
    *   **Orchestrator (in Termux):** Manages file operations in protected directories.
    *   **Workshop (in Debian):** A clean environment for running asset processing tools.

## Prerequisites

This tool is designed to run exclusively on **Android**. You will need:
1.  **Termux:** The primary terminal emulator for Android.
2.  **High-Privilege Access:** Your device must have one of the following:
    *   **Root Access:** The `su` binary must be available to Termux.
    *   **Shizuku:** The Shizuku app must be installed and running.

## Installation (Recommended for All Users)

The entire setup process is automated. You only need to run one script.

1.  **Download the Installer:**
    Download the `install.sh` script to your Termux home directory (`~/`).

2.  **Make it Executable:**
    Open Termux and run this command to give the script permission to execute:
    ```bash
    chmod +x install.sh
    ```

3.  **Run the Installer:**
    Execute the script. It will handle everything else.
    ```bash
    ./install.sh
    ```

**What the installer does:**
*   Creates the main `kivotos_tool.py` script for you.
*   Installs and configures `proot-distro` with a Debian container.
*   Installs `ubt`, `UnityPy`, `Pillow`, and other dependencies inside the Debian container.
*   Checks for and correctly installs `rish` if you are using Shizuku.

Once it's finished, you are ready to start modding with the `kivotos_tool.py` script.

## The Standard Modding Workflow (`kivotos_tool.py`)

The `kivotos_tool.py` script, created by the installer, provides a straightforward, step-by-step process. All commands are run from the main Termux shell.

1.  **`copy <search_term> <folder>`:** Copies bundles from the game to your workspace.
2.  **`process extract <folder>`:** Extracts the copied bundles.
3.  **Edit Your Files:** Manually modify the extracted assets in `/sdcard/BA_Workspace/`.
4.  **`process repack <subfolder> <new_name.bundle>`:** Repacks your modified folder into a new bundle.
5.  **`deploy <mod_path> <original_name>`:** Deploys your modded bundle back into the game.

## üßë‚Äçüî¨ Advanced Alternative (For Nethunter / Pro Users)

For professional users or those running a full-featured root environment like **Kali Nethunter**, a more powerful, all-in-one script is available: `ba_asset_tool.py`.

This version is not created by the installer and must be downloaded separately. It is designed to be run **entirely within a single, root-privileged Linux environment** (like a Nethunter chroot or a `proot-distro` with `tsu`/`sudo`).

### Why use the Advanced Tool?
*   **Powerful Interactive Search:** Features an advanced menu for finding bundles. It performs a "Smart Scan" on startup to find character sprites, allows live filtering, and supports a "Broad Search" to discover new bundles on the fly.
*   **All-in-One Operation:** Extraction and repacking are handled within a single script, without needing to switch between a Termux orchestrator and a Debian worker.
*   **Direct Control:** Offers more direct control over the extraction and repacking process for users who are comfortable managing their own environment.

### Who Should Use This?
*   Users with a **Kali Nethunter** chroot.
*   Advanced users who run their `proot-distro` session with root privileges (e.g., using `tsu` or `sudo`).
*   Users who prefer an interactive menu over a step-by-step command workflow.

### Setup for the Advanced Tool
1.  **Ensure a Root Environment:** You must be inside a shell with root access (`whoami` should return `root`).
2.  **Install Dependencies:**
    ```bash
    pip install UnityPy Pillow
    ```
3.  **Download and Run:**
    Download the `ba_asset_tool.py` script and run it directly.
    ```bash
    python ba_asset_tool.py extract
    ```

**Note:** The standard `kivotos_tool.py` created by the installer is recommended for most users as it handles the complex permission bridging automatically. The advanced `ba_asset_tool.py` offers more power at the cost of requiring a more complex initial setup.
